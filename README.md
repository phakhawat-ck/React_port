# React Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project, built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**
It's my very first experience working with both technologies 

### ✨ Features:
- Built with React (Vite)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Fully responsive layout
- Custom components and clean UI design

### 💡 Developer Note:
This project marks my first time working with React and Tailwind CSS  
While the code may not be perfect yet, I'm continuously learning and actively improving it

📌 **Note:** This is my first React project, self-learned from online resources and tutorials  
AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) were used in less than 15% of the process — mainly for guidance and explanation
